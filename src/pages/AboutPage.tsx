            Project CRANE is monitoring real-time racist rhetoric on Twitter. There is evidence that online hate speech predicts hate crime and human rights groups have argued that
            exposure to online hate speech normalises such hatred for majority groups. We are hoping that tracking the changes in online sinophobic and racist rhetoric resulting
            from the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic allows for hard exposure to those uninformed, as well as turn into a tool for change within victims and supporting
            organizations.

            In 2013, Pew Research Center from the United States conducted a survey over sinophobia, finding that China was viewed favorably in just half (19 of 38) of the nations
            surveyed, excluding China itself. Sinophobia is defined as the consistent hostility toward people of Chinese origin or toward Chinese culture, people, history, or
            government. It is also said to include the fear or dislike of Chinese-made goods.

          <body>
            Sinophobia and anti-Asian speech have always been actively present, as well as other racist speech within social media. The COVID-19 not only exposed this hate, but
            allowed many of us to witness it as we are more than ever stuck in our phones. And more than ever, these racist attackers are on their phones as well spreading their
            words. Racist rhetoric affects everyone, from the “normalization” of racist slurs to the immense and disproportionate death rate in black and brown communities. Racism
            is causing more lives in this pandemic, we must expose this data, and urge for change.

            Through the collection and analysis of large-scale datasets, I develop novel and robust mitigation techniques to make the Internet a safer place. My research involves a

            online social network compromises.
