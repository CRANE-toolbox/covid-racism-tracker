        Project CRANE uses a word embedding algorithm to identify the words linked to a given keyword, for a given period of time. For each keyword, forty words are extracted: they are those used in a context the most similar to that of the given keyword. It reproduces this analysis for several keywords
        (related to China, Covid19, and otherness) and for each month from Nov 2019 to Dec 2020.
