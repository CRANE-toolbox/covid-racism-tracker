                  Before designing this website, our team has conducted preliminary user research, specifically ethnographic interviews
                  and online surveys, to gain a better understanding of the public’s perception of COVID-19 related hate speech, racism,
                  and xenophobia/sinophobia. By reaching out to stakeholders, we ensured that our results will support anti-racist actions
                  and provided them with the necessary contextual information. In addition to this, we have conducted user testing around
                  accessibility issues, including but not limited to responsiveness, readability and color contrasts.
                  </p>
                  <p>Below are examples of anonymous testimonials we collected during our interviews!</p>

                  <strong>Q: How has COVID-19 made an impact in your life? (This can be regarding anything: education, earnings,
                  living, mental health, how you spend your day, etc.)</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A: Disconnect from physical expressions of love for family and friends, loss of spontaneity, loss of
                  community wide entertainment, the virus has victimized us; physically, financially, socially, emotionally,
                   and spiritually.

                  <strong>Q: Have you seen individuals be targeted based on their identity with the rise of the pandemic? If so,
                  if you are comfortable doing so, can you indicate to what extent targeting has had on these individuals?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A: I have not witnessed this personally, but I live in a fairly homogeneous community. I can see and grieve
                  for the additional burden on black men, in particular, for wearing masks. I can see “essential workers”
                   are expected to turn up at low paying, high risk jobs -- many of these are people of color.

                  <strong>Q: If there were a webpage to document the spread of racist rhetoric related to the COVID-19 pandemic,
                   what characteristics do you think would be needed in order for the tool to be beneficial/purposeful?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A: If there’s a pattern of misassigned blame, correcting that factually is useful. Other than that,
                  sites that already track hate could include COVID-19 considerations
